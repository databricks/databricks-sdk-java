/**
 * A securable in Databricks can be configured as __OPEN__ or __ISOLATED__. An __OPEN__ securable
 * can be accessed from any workspace, while an __ISOLATED__ securable can only be accessed from a
 * configured list of workspaces. This API allows you to configure (bind) securables to workspaces.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: The __isolation_mode__ is configured for the securable itself (using its Update method)
 * and the workspace bindings are only consulted when the securable's __isolation_mode__ is set to
 * __ISOLATED__.
 *
 * <p>A securable's workspace bindings can be configured by a metastore admin or the owner of the
 * securable.
 *
 * <p>The original path (/api/2.1/unity-catalog/workspace-bindings/catalogs/{name}) is deprecated.
 * Please use the new path (/api/2.1/unity-catalog/bindings/{securable_type}/{securable_name}) which
 * introduces the ability to bind a securable in READ_ONLY mode (catalogs only).
 *
 * <p>Securables that support binding: - catalog
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
