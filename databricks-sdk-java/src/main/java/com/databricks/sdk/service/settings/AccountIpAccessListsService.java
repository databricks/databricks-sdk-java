/**
 * The Accounts IP Access List API enables account admins to configure IP access lists for access to
 * the account console.
 *
 * <p>Account IP Access Lists affect web application access and REST API access to the account
 * console and account APIs. If the feature is disabled for the account, all access is allowed for
 * this account. There is support for allow lists (inclusion) and block lists (exclusion).
 *
 * <p>When a connection is attempted: 1. **First, all block lists are checked.** If the connection
 * IP address matches any block list, the connection is rejected. 2. **If the connection was not
 * rejected by block lists**, the IP address is compared with the allow lists.
 *
 * <p>If there is at least one allow list for the account, the connection is allowed only if the IP
 * address matches an allow list. If there are no allow lists for the account, all IP addresses are
 * allowed.
 *
 * <p>For all allow lists and block lists combined, the account supports a maximum of 1000 IP/CIDR
 * values, where one CIDR counts as a single value.
 *
 * <p>After changes to the account-level IP access lists, it can take a few minutes for changes to
 * take effect.
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
