/**
 * There are 2 types of Vector Search indexes: - `DELTA_SYNC`: An index that automatically syncs
 * with a source Delta Table, automatically and incrementally updating the index as the underlying
 * data in the Delta Table changes. - `DIRECT_ACCESS`: An index that supports direct read and write
 * of vectors and metadata through our REST and SDK APIs. With this model, the user manages index
 * updates.
