/**
 * The Restrict Workspace Admins setting lets you control the capabilities of workspace admins. With

 * access tokens on behalf of any service principal in their workspace. Workspace admins can also
 * change a job owner to any user in their workspace. And they can change the job run_as setting to
 * any user in their workspace or to a service principal on which they have the Service Principal
 * User role. With the setting status set to RESTRICT_TOKENS_AND_JOB_RUN_AS, workspace admins can
 * only create personal access tokens on behalf of service principals they have the Service
 * Principal User role on. They can also only change a job owner to themselves. And they can change
 * the job run_as setting to themselves or to a service principal on which they have the Service
 * Principal User role.
