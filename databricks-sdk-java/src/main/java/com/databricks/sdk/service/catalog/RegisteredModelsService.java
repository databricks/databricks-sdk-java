/**
 * Databricks provides a hosted version of MLflow Model Registry in Unity Catalog. Models in Unity
 * Catalog provide centralized access control, auditing, lineage, and discovery of ML models across
 * Databricks workspaces.
 *
 * <p>An MLflow registered model resides in the third layer of Unity Catalogâ€™s three-level
 * namespace. Registered models contain model versions, which correspond to actual ML models (MLflow
 * models). Creating new model versions currently requires use of the MLflow Python client. Once
 * model versions are created, you can load them for batch inference using MLflow Python client
 * APIs, or deploy them for real-time serving using Databricks Model Serving.
 *
 * <p>All operations on registered models and model versions require USE_CATALOG permissions on the
 * enclosing catalog and USE_SCHEMA permissions on the enclosing schema. In addition, the following
 * additional privileges are required for various operations:
 *
 * <p>* To create a registered model, users must additionally have the CREATE_MODEL permission on
 * the target schema. * To view registered model or model version metadata, model version data
 * files, or invoke a model version, users must additionally have the EXECUTE permission on the
 * registered model * To update registered model or model version tags, users must additionally have
 * APPLY TAG permissions on the registered model * To update other registered model or model version
 * metadata (comments, aliases) create a new model version, or update permissions on the registered
 * model, users must be owners of the registered model.
 *
 * <p>Note: The securable type for models is "FUNCTION". When using REST APIs (e.g. tagging, grants)
 * that specify a securable type, use "FUNCTION" as the securable type.
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
