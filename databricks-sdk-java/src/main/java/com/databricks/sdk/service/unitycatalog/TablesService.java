 * A table resides in the third layer of Unity Catalogâ€™s three-level namespace. It contains rows of
 * data. To create a table, users must have CREATE_TABLE and USE_SCHEMA permissions on the schema,
 * and they must have the USE_CATALOG permission on its parent catalog. To query a table, users must
 * have the SELECT permission on the table, and they must have the USE_CATALOG permission on its
 * parent catalog and the USE_SCHEMA permission on its parent schema.
 *
 * <p>A table can be managed or external. From an API perspective, a __VIEW__ is a particular kind
 * of table (rather than a managed or external table).
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
