public enum RunLifeCycleState {
  BLOCKED, // The run is blocked on an upstream dependency.
  INTERNAL_ERROR, // An exceptional state that indicates a failure in the Jobs service, such as
  // network failure over a long period. If a run on a new cluster ends in the
  // `INTERNAL_ERROR` state, the Jobs service terminates the cluster as soon as
  // possible. This state is terminal.
  PENDING, // The run has been triggered. If there is not already an active run of the same
  // job, the cluster and execution context are being prepared. If there is
  // already an active run of the same job, the run immediately transitions into
  // the `SKIPPED` state without preparing any resources.
  RUNNING, // The task of this run is being executed.
  SKIPPED, // This run was aborted because a previous run of the same job was already
  // active. This state is terminal.
  TERMINATED, // The task of this run has completed, and the cluster and execution context
  // have been cleaned up. This state is terminal.
  TERMINATING, // The task of this run has completed, and the cluster and execution context are
  // being cleaned up.
  WAITING_FOR_RETRY, // The run is waiting for a retry.
