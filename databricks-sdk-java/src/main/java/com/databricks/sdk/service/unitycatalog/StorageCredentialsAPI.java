/**
 * A storage credential represents an authentication and authorization mechanism
 * for accessing data stored on your cloud tenant. Each storage credential is
 * subject to Unity Catalog access-control policies that control which users and
 * groups can access the credential. If a user does not have access to a storage
 * credential in Unity Catalog, the request fails and Unity Catalog does not
 * attempt to authenticate to your cloud tenant on the userâ€™s behalf.
 * 
 * Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage
 * credentials directly.
 * 
 * To create storage credentials, you must be a Databricks account admin. The
 * account admin who creates the storage credential can delegate ownership to
 * another user or group to manage permissions on it.
