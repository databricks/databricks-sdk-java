 * Primary key and foreign key constraints encode relationships between fields in tables.
 *
 * <p>Primary and foreign keys are informational only and are not enforced. Foreign keys must
 * reference a primary key in another table. This primary key is the parent constraint of the
 * foreign key and the table this primary key is on is the parent table of the foreign key.
 * Similarly, the foreign key is the child constraint of its referenced primary key; the table of
 * the foreign key is the child table of the primary key.
 *
 * <p>You can declare primary keys and foreign keys as part of the table specification during table
 * creation. You can also add or drop constraints on existing tables.
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
