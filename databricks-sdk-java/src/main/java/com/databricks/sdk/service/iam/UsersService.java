/**
 * User identities recognized by Databricks and represented by email addresses.
 * 
 * Databricks recommends using SCIM provisioning to sync users and groups
 * automatically from your identity provider to your Databricks workspace. SCIM
 * streamlines onboarding a new employee or team by using your identity provider
 * to create users and groups in Databricks workspace and give them the proper
 * level of access. When a user leaves your organization or no longer needs
 * access to Databricks workspace, admins can terminate the user in your
 * identity provider and that userâ€™s account will also be removed from
 * Databricks workspace. This ensures a consistent offboarding process and
 * prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data.
 *
 * This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
