 * Volumes are a Unity Catalog (UC) capability for accessing, storing, governing, organizing and
 * processing files. Use cases include running machine learning on unstructured data such as image,
 * audio, video, or PDF files, organizing data sets during the data exploration stages in data
 * science, working with libraries that require access to the local file system on cluster machines,
 * storing library and config files of arbitrary formats such as .whl or .txt centrally and
 * providing secure access across workspaces to it, or transforming and querying non-tabular data
 * files in ETL.
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
