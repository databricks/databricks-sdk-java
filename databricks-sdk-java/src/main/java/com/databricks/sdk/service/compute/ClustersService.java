/**
 * The Clusters API allows you to create, start, edit, list, terminate, and delete clusters.
 *
 * <p>Databricks maps cluster node instance types to compute units known as DBUs. See the instance
 * type pricing page for a list of the supported instance types and their corresponding DBUs.
 *
 * <p>A Databricks cluster is a set of computation resources and configurations on which you run
 * data engineering, data science, and data analytics workloads, such as production ETL pipelines,
 * streaming analytics, ad-hoc analytics, and machine learning.
 *
 * <p>You run these workloads as a set of commands in a notebook or as an automated job. Databricks
 * makes a distinction between all-purpose clusters and job clusters. You use all-purpose clusters
 * to analyze data collaboratively using interactive notebooks. You use job clusters to run fast and
 * robust automated jobs.
 *
 * <p>You can create an all-purpose cluster using the UI, CLI, or REST API. You can manually
 * terminate and restart an all-purpose cluster. Multiple users can share such clusters to do
 * collaborative interactive analysis.
 *
 * <p>IMPORTANT: Databricks retains cluster configuration information for up to 200 all-purpose
 * clusters terminated in the last 30 days and up to 30 job clusters recently terminated by the job
 * scheduler. To keep an all-purpose cluster configuration even after it has been terminated for
 * more than 30 days, an administrator can pin a cluster to the cluster list.
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
