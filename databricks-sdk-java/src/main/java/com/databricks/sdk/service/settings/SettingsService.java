/**
 * The default namespace setting API allows users to configure the default namespace for a
 * Databricks workspace.
 *
 * <p>Through this API, users can retrieve, set, or modify the default namespace used when queries
 * do not reference a fully qualified three-level name. For example, if you use the API to set
 * 'retail_prod' as the default catalog, then a query 'SELECT * FROM myTable' would reference the
 * object 'retail_prod.default.myTable' (the schema 'default' is always assumed).
 *
 * <p>This setting requires a restart of clusters and SQL warehouses to take effect. Additionally,
 * the default namespace only applies when using Unity Catalog-enabled compute.
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
