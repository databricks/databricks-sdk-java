 * The alerts API can be used to perform CRUD operations on alerts. An alert is a Databricks SQL
 * object that periodically runs a query, evaluates a condition of its result, and notifies one or
 * more users and/or notification destinations if the condition was met. Alerts can be scheduled
 * using the `sql_task` type of the Jobs API, e.g. :method:jobs/create.
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
