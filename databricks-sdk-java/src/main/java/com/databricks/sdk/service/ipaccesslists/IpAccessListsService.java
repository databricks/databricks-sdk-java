/**
 * IP Access List enables admins to configure IP access lists.
 *
 * <p>IP access lists affect web application access and REST API access to this workspace only. If
 * the feature is disabled for a workspace, all access is allowed for this workspace. There is
 * support for allow lists (inclusion) and block lists (exclusion).
 *
 * <p>When a connection is attempted: 1. **First, all block lists are checked.** If the connection
 * IP address matches any block list, the connection is rejected. 2. **If the connection was not
 * rejected by block lists**, the IP address is compared with the allow lists.
 *
 * <p>If there is at least one allow list for the workspace, the connection is allowed only if the
 * IP address matches an allow list. If there are no allow lists for the workspace, all IP addresses
 * are allowed.
 *
 * <p>For all allow lists and block lists combined, the workspace supports a maximum of 1000 IP/CIDR
 * values, where one CIDR counts as a single value.
 *
 * <p>After changes to the IP access list feature, it can take a few minutes for changes to take
 * effect.
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
