 * User identities recognized by Databricks and represented by email addresses.

 * <p>Databricks recommends using SCIM provisioning to sync users and groups automatically from your
 * identity provider to your Databricks Account. SCIM streamlines onboarding a new employee or team
 * by using your identity provider to create users and groups in Databricks Account and give them
 * the proper level of access. When a user leaves your organization or no longer needs access to
 * Databricks Account, admins can terminate the user in your identity provider and that userâ€™s
 * account will also be removed from Databricks Account. This ensures a consistent offboarding
 * process and prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data.
