/**
 * The Jobs API allows you to create, edit, and delete jobs.
 *
 * <p>You can use a Databricks job to run a data processing or data analysis task in a Databricks
 * cluster with scalable resources. Your job can consist of a single task or can be a large,
 * multi-task workflow with complex dependencies. Databricks manages the task orchestration, cluster
 * management, monitoring, and error reporting for all of your jobs. You can run your jobs
 * immediately or periodically through an easy-to-use scheduling system. You can implement job tasks
 * using notebooks, JARS, Delta Live Tables pipelines, or Python, Scala, Spark submit, and Java
 * applications.
 *
 * <p>You should never hard code secrets or store them in plain text. Use the :service:secrets to
 * manage secrets in the [Databricks CLI]. Use the [Secrets utility] to reference secrets in
 * notebooks and jobs.
 *

 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
