/**
 * The Serving Endpoints API allows you to create, update, and delete model serving endpoints.
 *
 * <p>You can use a serving endpoint to serve models from the Databricks Model Registry or from
 * Unity Catalog. Endpoints expose the underlying models as scalable REST API endpoints using
 * serverless compute. This means the endpoints and associated compute resources are fully managed
 * by Databricks and will not appear in your cloud account. A serving endpoint can consist of one or
 * more MLflow models from the Databricks Model Registry, called served entities. A serving endpoint
 * can have at most ten served entities. You can configure traffic settings to define how requests
 * should be routed to your served entities behind an endpoint. Additionally, you can configure the
 * scale of resources that should be applied to each served entity.
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
