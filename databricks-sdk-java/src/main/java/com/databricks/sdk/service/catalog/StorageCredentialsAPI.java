/**
 * A storage credential represents an authentication and authorization mechanism for accessing data
 * stored on your cloud tenant. Each storage credential is subject to Unity Catalog access-control
 * policies that control which users and groups can access the credential. If a user does not have
 * access to a storage credential in Unity Catalog, the request fails and Unity Catalog does not
 * attempt to authenticate to your cloud tenant on the userâ€™s behalf.
 *
 * <p>Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage credentials directly.
 *
 * <p>To create storage credentials, you must be a Databricks account admin. The account admin who
 * creates the storage credential can delegate ownership to another user or group to manage
 * permissions on it.
