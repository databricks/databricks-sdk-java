/**
 * The code indicates why the run was terminated. Additional codes might be introduced in future
 * releases. * `SUCCESS`: The run was completed successfully. * `USER_CANCELED`: The run was
 * successfully canceled during execution by a user. * `CANCELED`: The run was canceled during
 * execution by the Databricks platform; for example, if the maximum run duration was exceeded. *
 * `SKIPPED`: Run was never executed, for example, if the upstream task run failed, the dependency
 * type condition was not met, or there were no material tasks to execute. * `INTERNAL_ERROR`: The
 * run encountered an unexpected error. Refer to the state message for further details. *
 * `DRIVER_ERROR`: The run encountered an error while communicating with the Spark Driver. *
 * `CLUSTER_ERROR`: The run failed due to a cluster error. Refer to the state message for further
 * details. * `REPOSITORY_CHECKOUT_FAILED`: Failed to complete the checkout due to an error when
 * communicating with the third party service. * `INVALID_CLUSTER_REQUEST`: The run failed because
 * it issued an invalid request to start the cluster. * `WORKSPACE_RUN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: The
 * workspace has reached the quota for the maximum number of concurrent active runs. Consider
 * scheduling the runs over a larger time frame. * `FEATURE_DISABLED`: The run failed because it
 * tried to access a feature unavailable for the workspace. * `CLUSTER_REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: The
 * number of cluster creation, start, and upsize requests have exceeded the allotted rate limit.
 * Consider spreading the run execution over a larger time frame. * `STORAGE_ACCESS_ERROR`: The run
 * failed due to an error when accessing the customer blob storage. Refer to the state message for
 * further details. * `RUN_EXECUTION_ERROR`: The run was completed with task failures. For more
 * details, refer to the state message or run output. * `UNAUTHORIZED_ERROR`: The run failed due to
 * a permission issue while accessing a resource. Refer to the state message for further details. *
 * `LIBRARY_INSTALLATION_ERROR`: The run failed while installing the user-requested library. Refer
 * to the state message for further details. The causes might include, but are not limited to: The
 * provided library is invalid, there are insufficient permissions to install the library, and so
 * forth. * `MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS_EXCEEDED`: The scheduled run exceeds the limit of maximum
 * concurrent runs set for the job. * `MAX_SPARK_CONTEXTS_EXCEEDED`: The run is scheduled on a
 * cluster that has already reached the maximum number of contexts it is configured to create. See:
 * [Link]. * `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`: A resource necessary for run execution does not exist. Refer to
 * the state message for further details. * `INVALID_RUN_CONFIGURATION`: The run failed due to an
 * invalid configuration. Refer to the state message for further details. * `CLOUD_FAILURE`: The run
 * failed due to a cloud provider issue. Refer to the state message for further details. *
 * `MAX_JOB_QUEUE_SIZE_EXCEEDED`: The run was skipped due to reaching the job level queue size
 * limit.
