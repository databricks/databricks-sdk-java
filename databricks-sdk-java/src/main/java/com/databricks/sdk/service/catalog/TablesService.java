/**
 * A table resides in the third layer of Unity Catalogâ€™s three-level namespace. It contains rows of
 * data. To create a table, users must have CREATE_TABLE and USE_SCHEMA permissions on the schema,
 * and they must have the USE_CATALOG permission on its parent catalog. To query a table, users must
 * have the SELECT permission on the table, and they must have the USE_CATALOG permission on its
 * parent catalog and the USE_SCHEMA permission on its parent schema.
 *
 * <p>A table can be managed or external. From an API perspective, a __VIEW__ is a particular kind
 * of table (rather than a managed or external table).
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.

  /**
   * Creates a new table in the specified catalog and schema.

   * <p>To create an external delta table, the caller must have the **EXTERNAL_USE_SCHEMA**
   * privilege on the parent schema and the **EXTERNAL_USE_LOCATION** privilege on the external
   * location. These privileges must always be granted explicitly, and cannot be inherited through
   * ownership or **ALL_PRIVILEGES**.
   *
   * <p>Standard UC permissions needed to create tables still apply: **USE_CATALOG** on the parent
   * catalog (or ownership of the parent catalog), **CREATE_TABLE** and **USE_SCHEMA** on the parent
   * schema (or ownership of the parent schema), and **CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE** on external location.
   *
   * <p>The **columns** field needs to be in a Spark compatible format, so we recommend you use
   * Spark to create these tables. The API itself does not validate the correctness of the column
   * spec. If the spec is not Spark compatible, the tables may not be readable by Databricks
   * Runtime.
   *
   * <p>NOTE: The Create Table API for external clients only supports creating **external delta
   * tables**. The values shown in the respective enums are all values supported by Databricks,
   * however for this specific Create Table API, only **table_type** **EXTERNAL** and
   * **data_source_format** **DELTA** are supported. Additionally, column masks are not supported
   * when creating tables through this API.
