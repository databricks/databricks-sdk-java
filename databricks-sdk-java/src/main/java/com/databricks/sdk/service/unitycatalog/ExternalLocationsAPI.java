/**
 * An external location is an object that combines a cloud storage path with a storage credential
 * that authorizes access to the cloud storage path. Each external location is subject to Unity
 * Catalog access-control policies that control which users and groups can access the credential. If
 * a user does not have access to an external location in Unity Catalog, the request fails and Unity
 * Catalog does not attempt to authenticate to your cloud tenant on the userâ€™s behalf.
 *
 * <p>Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage credentials directly.
 *
 * <p>To create external locations, you must be a metastore admin or a user with the
 * **CREATE_EXTERNAL_LOCATION** privilege.
