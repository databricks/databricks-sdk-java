/**
 * The SQL Permissions API is similar to the endpoints of the
 * :method:permissions/set. However, this exposes only one endpoint, which gets
 * the Access Control List for a given object. You cannot modify any permissions
 * using this API.
 * 
 * There are three levels of permission:
 * 
 * - `CAN_VIEW`: Allows read-only access
 * 
 * - `CAN_RUN`: Allows read access and run access (superset of `CAN_VIEW`)
 * 
 * - `CAN_MANAGE`: Allows all actions: read, run, edit, delete, modify
 * permissions (superset of `CAN_RUN`)
 *
 * This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
