/**
 * User identities recognized by Databricks and represented by email addresses.
 *
 * <p>Databricks recommends using SCIM provisioning to sync users and groups automatically from your
 * identity provider to your Databricks Workspace. SCIM streamlines onboarding a new employee or
 * team by using your identity provider to create users and groups in Databricks Workspace and give
 * them the proper level of access. When a user leaves your organization or no longer needs access
 * to Databricks Workspace, admins can terminate the user in your identity provider and that userâ€™s
 * account will also be removed from Databricks Workspace. This ensures a consistent offboarding
 * process and prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data.
 *
 * <p>This is the high-level interface, that contains generated methods.
 *
 * <p>Evolving: this interface is under development. Method signatures may change.
